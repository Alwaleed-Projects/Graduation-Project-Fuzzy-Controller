# 🎓 Graduation Project – Fuzzy Logic Controller Optimization

This project aims to enhance hybrid energy system performance by integrating a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) optimized using **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** and **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**. The system was modeled using **MATLAB** and integrated into **HOMER software** for simulation and analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Develop and implement an FLC to manage energy flow in hybrid systems (PV, Wind, Battery, Grid).
- Optimize the FLC using PSO and GA to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency.
- Compare results with conventional HOMER control methods: Load Following (LF) and Cycle Charging (CC).

## 🧠 Tools & Software
- MATLAB (Fuzzy Logic Toolbox + Scripts)
- HOMER Software (Energy modeling)
- PSO and GA algorithms
- Excel (for data handling)
